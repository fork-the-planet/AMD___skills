"""Behavioral tests for the `serving-llms-on-epyc` skill.

Run locally (needs the `claude` CLI authenticated; the agent does not actually
launch a server in the judge's sandbox, so this grades the *plan/behavior*, not
a live endpoint):

    pytest eval/behavioral/tests/test_serving_llms_on_epyc.py -s

`logs_contains` is deterministic; `should` / `should_not` are graded by an LLM
judge over the captured evidence (tool calls + outputs), so the agent's prose
cannot fake a pass.
