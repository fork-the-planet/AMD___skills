# Federate Your Repo Into the Catalog

How to list skills that live in **your own AMD repo** in this catalog. Your repo
stays the source of truth; the catalog vendors a pinned copy.

This is the detailed version of **Path B** in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#path-b-skills-authored-in-a-product-repository-federation).
Start there for an overview of how it compares to authoring skills directly in
this repo.

> **Eligibility: AMD-owned repositories only.** The source `repo` must be under
> an AMD GitHub org (e.g. `AMD-AGI/...`). Non-AMD repos are not accepted.

## Prerequisites

- Each skill is a folder with a valid `SKILL.md` and `skill-card.md`.
  See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [skill-cards.md](skill-cards.md).
- Skills live in a known directory in your repo (e.g. `skills/`).
- Pick a branch to track (e.g. `main` or a release branch).

## Add your source

Edit [`.github/scripts/sources.yml`](../.github/scripts/sources.yml) and append an entry:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: amd-myproject          # kebab-case source id
    repo: AMD-Org/MyProject      # must be AMD-owned
    ref: main                    # branch to track (e.g. main or a release branch)
    path: skills                 # dir in your repo holding the skill folders
    license: MIT                 # SPDX id, carried into the marker file
    skills:
      - name: my-skill           # folder name in your repo
        as: myproject-my-skill   # local catalog name: <project>-<skill>
```

Use `as:` to namespace skills as `<project>-<skill>` so catalog names stay unique.

## Import

Run the import scripts locally (they read `sources.yml` from your working tree),
then open a PR for review.

1. Vendor the skills and refresh the manifests:

   ```bash
   uv run .github/scripts/import_external_skills.py    # vendor into skills/<name>/
   uv run .github/scripts/generate_cursor_marketplace.py
   ./.github/scripts/check.sh                          # validate
   ```

2. Commit `skills/**`, `.github/scripts/sources.yml`, and the manifests.
3. Open a PR; a maintainer reviews and merges once CI passes.

## Catch failures before nightly

The catalog runs checks against your skills. Run the **same** checks in your own
repo by calling them as reusable workflows, so you catch breakage during normal
development instead of in the catalog's nightly run. The logic and config live in
`amd/skills`, so green in your repo means green in the catalog — and you never copy
or maintain the check yourself.

Add a caller workflow to your repo (e.g. `.github/workflows/skills-checks.yml`):

```yaml
name: skills-checks
on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  external-references:
    uses: amd/skills/.github/workflows/external-reference-check.yml@main
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
```

## Update or remove

Automatic refresh and pruning will soon be enabled through nightly workflows.

Never hand-edit vendored skills under `skills/`; changes must come from your repo
via re-import, or they'll be overwritten.
